It's been a few years since I worked on it, and deployed it.  
One of the reasons why I stopped was because I was starting to 
feel a little paranoid about having people use the software,
and thus exposing readers to a lot of data collection and data
mining, particularly given that these pages might be used to
record information about street protests.

The way crowsnest works, even if the site hosting the software
doesn't log traffic, all the sites included on the page will
log all the traffic.

Moreover, even if an individual company cannot notice patterns,
a government agency that subpoenas the data can quickly correlate
IP addresses and basically reconstruct what was seen on the page.

The LA Indymedia policy is not only not to log IP addresses,
but to discourage embedding anything into a page that may act
like a beacon.  They can do that, but we don't really like it.

That said, I'm starting to think about ways to proxy all the
data rather than simply use javascript to include code from 
social media sites.

Additionally, it would be interesting to see if it's possible
to replace things like GMaps with OSMaps.
